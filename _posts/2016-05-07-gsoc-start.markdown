<h1> Google Summer of Code </h1>	
This is my first blog post in the series where I'll be posting my updates about GSoC 2016.
I'll start from the beginning. 
I started doing open source a year back when I was introduced to this awesome campus group SDSLabs, here at IIT Roorkee.
I worked on some internal projects, biggest one being a chess playing platform for the intranet of IIT Roorkee. It mainly involved javascript as the language. 
I was previously contributing to the Processing foundation. I really liked the work that they were doing and was enjoying the experience. But they didn't get selected as a GSoC organisation this year. 
I was introduced to Gambit while I was scrolling through this years organisations selected in GSoC. I found their work interesting and the project quite optimum to my capabilities.
I went through the code in the month of March and April and started contributing. I loved interacting with the mentors who were very helpful along the way and since I loved the work that they were offering, I didn't apply for any other organisation.

<h1> The Project </h1>
My project revolves around porting the flash version of the Game theory explorer to Javascript which would make further development easier. 
I have made my proposal open and it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbIrPj-IAaJ1FzWCzDp2vmbaC40A5X8ZdSLrjtCm0eg/edit#)  
The github repository containing the current code of the project can be found [here](github.com/gambitproject/jsgte).
I'm currently in the middle of my community bonding period and am looking forward to an awesome adventure.
